This Dapp is written as part of my intern with Flex Dapps Pty Ltd.

The front-end is written in <a href="https://svelte.dev/"> Svelte </a>

The app uses `IPFS` as a decentralized file storage and `webpack` to facilitate the web functionalities.

<a href="https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs"> JS-IPFS </a> is used to interact with IPFS.

And, of course, this cannot be a Dapp without using `web3`, find out more <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/index.html"> here </a>.

Run this app by installing aforementioned dependencies and `npm run dev`
